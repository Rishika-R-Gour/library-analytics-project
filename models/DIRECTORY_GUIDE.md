# 📁 **Complete Model Directory Usage Guide**

## 🗂️ **What Goes in Each Folder**

### 1. **`archived/` - Model Version History**
**Purpose**: Store previous versions of models that have been replaced or retired.

**Contents**:
- **Retired production models** with complete metadata
- **Performance comparison** with replacement models
- **Lessons learned** from each model iteration
- **Deployment history** and retirement reasons
- **Migration notes** for version upgrades

**Example Structure**:
```
archived/
├── overdue_prediction/
│   ├── metadata_v0.9.2.json (Logistic Regression - retired)
│   ├── metadata_v0.8.1.json (Decision Tree - retired) 
│   └── overdue_prediction_model_v0.9.2.pkl
├── churn_prediction/
│   └── metadata_v0.7.3.json (Naive Bayes - retired)
└── recommendation_engine/
    └── metadata_v0.5.1.json (Simple CF - retired)
```

**When to Archive**:
- Model replaced by better version
- Algorithm change (e.g., Logistic → Random Forest)
- Significant architecture updates
- End of model lifecycle

---

### 2. **`experiments/` - Research & Development**
**Purpose**: Test new algorithms, features, and approaches before moving to staging.

**Contents**:
- **Research prototypes** with experimental algorithms
- **Feature engineering experiments** and ablation studies
- **Algorithm comparisons** (A vs B vs C)
- **Hyperparameter tuning** results and configurations
- **Innovation projects** (deep learning, reinforcement learning)

**Example Structure**:
```
experiments/
├── deep_learning_recommendations/
│   ├── experiment_log.json
│   ├── neural_cf_model.pkl
│   ├── transformer_model.pkl
│   └── README.md
├── ensemble_overdue_prediction/
│   ├── voting_classifier_results.json
│   ├── stacking_approach.pkl
│   └── performance_comparison.csv
└── anomaly_detection_loans/
    ├── isolation_forest_experiment.json
    ├── one_class_svm_results.json
    └── autoencoder_approach.pkl
```

**What Gets Experimented**:
- New algorithms (Neural Networks, XGBoost, etc.)
- Feature combinations and engineering
- Different data preprocessing approaches
- Novel business problem solutions

---

### 3. **`staging/` - Pre-Production Testing**
**Purpose**: Test validated models in production-like environment before full deployment.

**Contents**:
- **Models ready for production** with improved performance
- **A/B testing configurations** and shadow mode setups
- **Validation test results** (unit, integration, performance)
- **Gradual rollout plans** and rollback procedures
- **Production compatibility** testing results

**Example Structure**:
```
staging/
├── churn_prediction_v1.1/
│   ├── metadata.json (XGBoost upgrade)
│   ├── churn_prediction_model_v1.1.0.pkl
│   ├── validation_results.json
│   └── ab_test_config.json
├── recommendation_engine_v1.2/
│   ├── metadata.json (Neural CF integration)
│   ├── recommendation_model_v1.2.0.pkl
│   └── shadow_mode_results.json
└── demand_forecasting_v1.1/
    ├── metadata.json (Seasonal improvements)
    └── demand_model_v1.1.0.pkl
```

**Staging Process**:
1. **Validation Testing**: Unit, integration, performance tests
2. **Shadow Mode**: Run alongside production without affecting results
3. **A/B Testing**: Gradual traffic split (10% → 25% → 50% → 100%)
4. **Monitoring**: Performance, accuracy, response time tracking
5. **Approval**: Business and technical sign-off

---

### 4. **`metadata/` - Global Model Information**
**Purpose**: Centralized tracking and management of all models across environments.

**Contents**:
- **Model registry** with all model versions and status
- **Performance tracking** across time and environments
- **Dependency management** (libraries, infrastructure requirements)
- **Business impact metrics** and ROI tracking
- **Deployment schedules** and maintenance windows

**Example Structure**:
```
metadata/
├── model_registry.json (Central model catalog)
├── performance_tracking.md (Daily/weekly metrics)
├── dependency_matrix.json (Library versions, requirements)
├── business_impact_report.json (ROI, cost savings)
├── deployment_schedule.json (Planned updates)
└── alerts_and_monitoring.json (Threshold configurations)
```

**Key Tracking Information**:
- Model versions across all environments
- Performance trends and drift detection
- Business KPIs and financial impact
- Infrastructure utilization and costs
- Compliance and audit trails

## 🔄 **Complete Model Lifecycle Flow**

```
Research → Experiments → Staging → Production → Archived

```

### **Example Lifecycle**:

1. **Research Phase**: "Can we improve churn prediction accuracy?"
2. **Experiments**: Test XGBoost vs Neural Networks vs Ensemble methods
3. **Staging**: XGBoost shows 2.3% improvement → staging validation
4. **Production**: Gradual rollout after successful A/B testing
5. **Archived**: Previous Gradient Boosting model archived with lessons learned

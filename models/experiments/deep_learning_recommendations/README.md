# Deep Learning Recommendation Experiments

## Experiment Overview
Testing advanced neural network architectures to improve book recommendation accuracy beyond the current 74.2% baseline.

## Models Under Investigation

### 1. Neural Collaborative Filtering (NCF)
- **Architecture**: User/Item embeddings â†’ Deep Neural Network
- **Results**: 82.3% accuracy (11% improvement)
- **Pros**: Significant accuracy gain, reasonable inference time
- **Cons**: Higher computational requirements

### 2. Transformer-based Recommendations
- **Architecture**: Self-attention mechanism for sequential recommendations
- **Results**: 79.1% accuracy but 32ms inference time
- **Pros**: Good at capturing sequential patterns
- **Cons**: Too slow for real-time recommendations

### 3. Variational Autoencoder (VAE)
- **Architecture**: Encoder-decoder with latent space modeling
- **Results**: 73.5% accuracy (below baseline)
- **Pros**: Fast inference, good for cold-start problems
- **Cons**: Lower accuracy than current model

## Experimental Setup
```python
# Training configuration
batch_size = 256
learning_rate = 0.001
epochs = 100
validation_split = 0.1
early_stopping = True

# Hardware

```

## Key Findings
1. **Neural CF is most promising** - 11% accuracy improvement
2. **Transformer too slow** for production real-time requirements
3. **VAE underperforms** current hybrid approach
4. **Trade-off exists** between accuracy and inference speed

## Next Phase
- Optimize Neural CF for production deployment
- Implement A/B testing framework
- Evaluate production resource requirements
